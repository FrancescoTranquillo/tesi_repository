  shorttitle = {{{MRIQC}}},
  doi = {10.1101/111294},
  abstract = {Quality control of MRI is essential for excluding problematic acquisitions and avoiding bias in subsequent image processing and analysis. Visual inspection is subjective and impractical for large scale datasets. Although automated quality assessments have been demonstrated on single-site datasets, it is unclear that solutions can generalize to unseen data acquired at new sites. Here, we introduce the MRI Quality Control tool (MRIQC ), a tool for extracting quality measures and fitting a binary (accept/exclude) classifier. Our tool can be run both locally and as a free online service via the OpenNeuro.org portal. The classifier is trained on a publicly available, multi-site dataset (17 sites, N=1102). We perform model selection evaluating different normalization and feature exclusion approaches aimed at maximizing across-site generalization and estimate an accuracy of 76\%{$\pm$}13\% on new sites, using leave-one-site-out cross-validation. We confirm that result on a held-out dataset (2 sites, N=265) also obtaining a 76\% accuracy. Even though the performance of the trained classifier is statistically above chance, we show that it is susceptible to site effects and unable to account for artifacts specific to new sites. MRIQC performs with high accuracy in intra-site prediction, but performance on unseen sites leaves space for improvement which might require more labeled data and new approaches to the between-site variability. Overcoming these limitations is crucial for a more objective quality assessment of neuroimaging data, and to enable the analysis of extremely large and multi-site samples.},

The method can further include locally storing at the medical device the measured parameter value, the parameter type, and a first value that indicates when the measured parameter value was measured; accessing a maintenance threshold value that specifies a performance limit for the parameter type; compar ing the maintenance threshold value with the measured parameter value; and generating an alert based on the com paring to indicate that maintenance is needed for the compo nent.

Streaming data analysis has become popular after being successfully used in many applications including forecasting electricity load, stock market prices, weather conditions, etc. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been successfully utilized in understanding the embedded interesting patterns/behaviors in the data and forecasting the future values based on it. One such pattern is modelled and learned in the present study to identify the occurrence of a specific pattern in a Water Management System (WMS). This prediction aids in making an automatic decision support system, to switch OFF a hydraulic suction pump at the appropriate time. Three types of ANN, namely Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO), Multi-Input Single-Output (MISO), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) have been compared, for multi-step-ahead forecasting, on a sensor's streaming data. Experiments have shown that RNN has the best performance among three models and based on its prediction, a system can be implemented to make the best decision with 86\% accuracy.},

We present a data-driven approach based on multiple-instance learning for predicting equipment failures by mining equipment event logs which, while usually not designed for predicting failures, contain rich operational information. We discuss problem domain and formulation, evaluation metrics and predictive maintenance work flow. We experimentally compare our approach to competing methods. For evaluation, we use real life datasets with billions of log messages from two large fleets of medical equipment. We share insights gained from mining such data. Our predictive maintenance approach, deployed by a major medical device provider over the past several months, learns and evaluates predictive models from terabytes of log data, and actively monitors thousands of medical scanners.},

Stacking recurrent hidden layers in such networks also enables the learning of higher level temporal features, for faster learning with sparser representations. In this paper, we use stacked LSTM networks for anomaly/fault detection in time series. A network is trained on non-anomalous data and used as a predictor over a number of time steps. The resulting prediction errors are modeled as a multivariate Gaussian distribution, which is used to assess the likelihood of anomalous behavior. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated on four datasets: ECG, space shuttle, power demand, and multi-sensor engine dataset.},
