  abstract = {Advances in medical technology is not sufficient
alone to satisfy the growing and emerging needs such as
improving quality of life, providing healthcare services tailored to each individual, ensuring efficient management of care and
creating sustainable social healthcare. There is a potential for
substantially enhancing healthcare services by integrating
information technologies, social networking technologies,
digitization and control of biomedical devices, and utilization of big data technologies as well as machine learning techniques.
Today, data has become more ubiquitous and accessible by virtue
of advancements in smart sensor and actuator technologies. This
in turn allow us to collect significant amount of data from
biomedical devices and automate certain healthcare functions. In
order to get maximum benefit from the generated data, there is a
need to develop new models and distributed data analytics
approaches for health industry. Big data has the potential to
improve the quality and efficiency of health care services as well as reducing the maintenance costs by minimizing the risks
related with malfunctions of biomedical devices. Hospitals grasp
this noteworthy potential and convert collected data into valuable information that can be used for several purposes including
management of biomedical device maintenance. To this end, in
this study, by leveraging the latest advancements in big data
analytics technologies, we propose a scalable predictive
maintenance architecture for healthcare domain. We also
discussed the opportunities and challenges of utilizing the
proposed architecture in the healthcare domain.},

We discuss problem domain and formulation, evaluation metrics and predictive maintenance work flow. We experimentally compare our approach to competing methods. For evaluation, we use real life datasets with billions of log messages from two large fleets of medical equipment. We share insights gained from mining such data.

  abstract = {Quality control of MRI is essential for excluding problematic acquisitions and avoiding bias in subsequent image processing and analysis. Visual inspection is subjective and impractical for large scale datasets. Although automated quality assessments have been demonstrated on single-site datasets, it is unclear that solutions can generalize to unseen data acquired at new sites. Here, we introduce the MRI Quality Control tool (MRIQC ), a tool for extracting quality measures and fitting a binary (accept/exclude) classifier. Our tool can be run both locally and as a free online service via the OpenNeuro.org portal. The classifier is trained on a publicly available, multi-site dataset (17 sites, N=1102). We perform model selection evaluating different normalization and feature exclusion approaches aimed at maximizing across-site generalization and estimate an accuracy of 76\%{$\pm$}13\% on new sites, using leave-one-site-out cross-validation. We confirm that result on a held-out dataset (2 sites, N=265) also obtaining a 76\% accuracy. Even though the performance of the trained classifier is statistically above chance, we show that it is susceptible to site effects and unable to account for artifacts specific to new sites. MRIQC performs with high accuracy in intra-site prediction, but performance on unseen sites leaves space for improvement which might require more labeled data and new approaches to the between-site variability. Overcoming these limitations is crucial for a more objective quality assessment of neuroimaging data, and to enable the analysis of extremely large and multi-site samples.},

One such pattern is modelled and learned in the present study to identify the occurrence of a specific pattern in a Water Management System (WMS). This prediction aids in making an automatic decision support system, to switch OFF a hydraulic suction pump at the appropriate time. Three types of ANN, namely Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO), Multi-Input Single-Output (MISO), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) have been compared, for multi-step-ahead forecasting, on a sensor's streaming data.

  abstract = {Estimation of future mortality rates still plays a central role among life insurers in pricing their products and managing longevity risk. In the literature on mortality modeling, a wide number of stochastic models have been proposed, most of them forecasting future mortality rates by extrapolating one or more latent factors. The abundance of proposed models shows that forecasting future mortality from historical trends is non-trivial. Following the idea proposed in Deprez et al. (2017), we use machine learning algorithms, able to catch patterns that are not commonly identifiable, to calibrate a parameter (the machine learning estimator), improving the goodness of fit of standard stochastic mortality models. The machine learning estimator is then forecasted according to the Lee-Carter framework, allowing one to obtain a higher forecasting quality of the standard stochastic models. Out-of sample forecasts are provided to verify the model accuracy.},

This study used web search query volume to predict visitor numbers for a popular tourist destination in China, and compared the predictive power of the search data of two different search engines, Google and Baidu. The study verified the co-integration relationship between search engine query data and visitor volumes to Hainan Province. Compared to the corresponding auto-regression moving average (ARMA) models, both types of search engine data helped to significantly decrease forecasting errors. However, Baidu data performed better due to its larger market share in China. The study demonstrated the value of search engine data, proposed a method for selecting predictive queries, and showed the locality of the data for forecasting tourism demand.},

  abstract = {Solar activity, particularly solar flares can have
significant detrimental effects on both space-borne and grounds
based systems and industries leading to subsequent impacts on
our lives. As a consequence, there is much current interest in
creating systems which can make accurate solar flare
predictions. This paper aims to develop a novel framework to
predict solar flares by making use of the Geostationary
Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) X-ray flux 1-
minute time series data. This data is fed to three integrated
neural networks to deliver these predictions. The first neural
network (NN) is used to convert GOES X-ray flux 1-minute data
to Markov Transition Field (MTF) images. The second neural
network uses an unsupervised feature learning algorithm to learn
the MTF image features. The third neural network uses both the
learned features and the MTF images, which are then processed
using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network to generate the
flares predictions. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first flare prediction system that is based entirely on the analysis of pre-flare GOES X-ray flux data. The results are evaluated
using several performance measurement criteria that are
presented in this paper.},

In this paper, an artificial neural network (ANN) based method is developed for achieving more accurate remaining useful life prediction of equipment subject to condition monitoring. The ANN model takes the age and multiple condition monitoring measurement values at the present and previous inspection points as the inputs, and the life percentage as the output. A function generalized from the Weibull failure rate function is used to fit each condition monitoring measurement series for a failure history, and the fitted measurement values are used to form the ANN training set so as to reduce the effects of the noise factors that are irrelevant to the equipment degradation. A validation mechanism is introduced in the ANN training process to improve the prediction performance of the ANN model. The proposed ANN method is validated using real-world vibration monitoring data collected from pump bearings in the field. A comparative study is performed between the proposed ANN method and an adapted version of a reported method, and the results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method in achieving more accurate remaining useful life prediction.},

  abstract = {We present a learning approach designed to detect possible anomalies in photovoltaic (PV) systems in order to let an operator to plan predictive maintenance interventions. The anomaly detection algorithm presented is based on the comparison between the measured and the predicted values of the AC power production. The model designed to predict the AC power production is based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), that is capable of estimating the AC power production using solar irradiance and PV panel temperature measurements, and that is trained using a dataset previously gathered from the plant to be monitored. Live trend data coming from the PV system are then compared with the output of the model and the vector of residuals is analyzed to detect anomalies and generate daily predictive maintenance alerts; there residuals are aggregated over 1-day and processed to detect out-of-threshold samples and system degradation trends; these trends are extracted by computing the Triangular Moving Average (TMA) where the window size is automatically determined. The paper also reports experimental data results revealing that the model leads to a good anomaly detection rate, which is measured as a positive predictive detection rate greater than 90\%. Moreover, the algorithm is able to recognize trends of system's deviations from normal operation behavior and generate predictive maintenance alerts as a decision support system for operatives, with the aim of avoiding possible incoming failures.},
